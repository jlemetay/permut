1. Introduction                                            permut-introduction

Sometimes, when I meet a file with text data organized in columns, it takes me
some minutes to re-arrange the order of columns as I wish, and in general, I
use awk, sed or a combination of these external commands to do the treatment.
I decided to find a Vim plugin that swap columns of text, not just colums of
words as the "swapcol-vim" plugin (https://github.com/vim-scripts/swapcol.vim).
I have not found one plugin that makes this work. So I decided to build it.
I called it 'permut', a word derived from the french verb 'permuter', which
means 'to swap'.

In brief, permut.vim plugin allows to swap columns of text. It takes only
some seconds, just the time to enter the command and it is very easy to use
(from my standpoint =;o).


==============================================================================
2. Dependency                                                permut-dependency

The permut.vim plugin does not manage the column alignment, its job is only
to swap columns of text.

If you want to have automatic column alignments, install one of the following
text aligner plugins in your environment:
[1] [tabular plugin](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular)
[2] [vim-easy-align plugin](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align)

By default, when one (at least) of these Vim plugins is installed in your
environment, the permut plugin detect it and uses it automatically
to align the columns of text.

If it is not what you want for any reason, this behavior can be inhibited
by setting configuration variables in your ~/.vimrc file.
To prevent the permut plugin to use the tabular plugin, set
let g:permut_disable_tabular_usage=1
To prevent the permut plugin to use the vim-easy-align plugin, set
let g:permut_disable_vim_easy_align_usage=1


==============================================================================
3. Usage                                                          permut-usage

:<range> Permut <colnum1> <colnum2> [column_separator]

By default, the column_separator is '|' character. The user can enter any kind
of separator character (not present in the columns of text). The more usual
separator character encountered are the ',' or ';' or ':' characters.

4. Credits                                                      permut-credits

This Vim plugin is my two cents to the Vim editor that helps me a lot in my
daily work.

From my point of view, it was not so simple to start with Vimscript.  Vim
user's guide and reference manual are really rich in information, but lack
something that gives a thread to build a Vim plugin directly (c.f. usr_41.txt).
There are a lot of documentation but strangely it is impossible to find a simple template.
Finally, I really started to grasp quickly the important Vimscript notions and
take the first step thanks to the following documentation:

[1] [Scripting the Vim editor, Part 1](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-1/)
[2] [Scripting the Vim editor, Part 2](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-2/)
[3] [Scripting the Vim editor, Part 3](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-3/)
[4] [Scripting the Vim editor, Part 4](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-4/)
[5] [Scripting the Vim editor, Part 5](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-vim-script-5/)
[6] [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/)

Moreover, after trying several plugin managers, I opted for "pathogen".
It is small, clean (contrary to its name =;o) and efficient as I like and
helped me to try a number of plugins easily.

So thanks to the following great Vim contributors:
Damian Conway
Steve Losh
Tim Pope
